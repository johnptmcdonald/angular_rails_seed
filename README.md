# angular_rails_seed

This is a basic starter app for angular on rails. The skeleton includes:

- gem 'angularjs-rails'

- gem 'bootstrap-sass'

- gem 'underscore-rails'

- ngRoute and ngResource modules


The javascript folder defines a module (“myApp”) and an initial controller (“FirstController”), as well as an initial route for this controller.

The default view is views/layouts/application.html.erb, which directs to other views held in public/templates/

No other changes have been made to the standard rails app skeleton.

To get started, simply bundle install.
